Bugs
- When starting a game and melding is calculated but melding is complete, you need to refresh to make it realize it.
- Moving down to the staging area should not change their position in the list
- Check for a remaining card when Playing in your foot so you can discard
- Check that You can discard the last card in your foot only if you have a clean and dirty book closed

Feature Requests:
- Show the last player and what they discarded
- Show feet that weren't picked up when scoring
- Validate on PLAY push that decks don't have 1 or 2 cards in them.
- Show staged cards below the pile so they can be moved (mainly for wilds)
    - Not necessary with Undo feature
- Find a way to show the whole game on the phone?
- A way to do multiple books of the same number
- See latest card on the discard pile
- synopsis of partner's last turn
